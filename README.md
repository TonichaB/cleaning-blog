For smaller screen sizes the navigation bar becomes hidden and the user is presented with a burger drop down icon which, when clicked, will show a dropdown list containing the navigation links. <br>

#### Register/Login/Logout

Within the header for the site, to the top right, there is a button for the user to firstly Register/Login to an account. This button will change after the user has logged in to instead show the username as a new dropdown link that when clicked shows an option for the user to log out. When first selecting to Register/Login the user is also presented initially with a Register modal containing a form to register, or if they already have an account they can select to login instead which amends the modal to now request the login details.
